# Build the distribution's modemmanager package with the E5's unisoc plugin.
#
#   openwrt/build-modemmanager.sh        -> out/openwrt/modemmanager-*.apk
#
# OpenWrt and ImmortalWrt 25.12 both ship ModemManager 1.24.0, the version
# rootfs/deb-patches/
# modemmanager-0[1-6]-*.patch are written against, so the Debian image and the
# OpenWrt one run the same plugin (docs/FINDINGS.md 37).  The patches go into
# the feed package's patches/ after OpenWrt's own (0001-0004, which they stack
# on cleanly), and patches/modemmanager-package-*.patch adjusts the package's
# OpenWrt glue (its hotplug helpers drop virtual netdevs, and sipa_eth0 is one).
#
# Built from the distribution's source tree at the release tag (E5_WRT_GIT,
# openwrt/wrt-distro.sh), in a container of the
# host's own architecture: the release SDK exists only as an x86_64 program,
# which Docker on an arm64 host can run only emulated -- far too slow (hours,
# for glib2 alone).  The buildroot builds its cross toolchain on any host, so
# it is set up exactly as the release was built -- the tag, the feeds pinned in
# the release's feeds.buildinfo, its config.buildinfo -- and the package comes
# out for the same toolchain (gcc, musl) as the repository's packages it is
# installed with.
#
# The tree lives in the Docker volume e5-<distribution>-src and is kept between
# runs: the first run builds the host tools and the toolchain (tens of
# minutes), a later one only ModemManager.  `docker volume rm e5-openwrt-src`
# (or e5-immortalwrt-src) starts over.
#
# Configuration: no QMI, MBIM or QRTR (this modem speaks AT only, and without
# them the package does not pull libqmi/libmbim/libqrtr in); AT commands over
# D-Bus on, as in the Debian build (mmcli --command, e5-at).
#
# The release is OpenWrt's plus 900 (1.24.0-r11 -> r911): the repository's
# package never looks newer, so `apk upgrade` does not replace this one with a
# modemmanager that has no unisoc plugin.  Plus E5REV, the revision of the E5
# patches: raised whenever one of them changes, so that apk takes the rebuilt
# package for a new one (it does not reinstall a version it has).

# 1: +IMSREGADDR/+SPNRINDICATE among the ignored unsolicited reports
# 2: context 1 is the modem's net port (sipa_eth8 for the second SIM card)
# 3: +SPSWDATA in the power-up from +CFUN: 0 (the port's card as the data card)
# 4: both cards up from +CFUN: 0, and +SPSWDATA before every dial (SIM card switch)
# 5: the work modes (+SPTESTMODEM) in that power-up, no stop on the other card's errors,
#    and the SIM slots (both cards listed; a switch through e5-sim)
# 6: rebuild legacy cached APKs and require a source/checksum manifest.
# 7: card-addressed SMS submit through the existing AT command owner.
# 8: native per-call SIM slot and dual-card voice tracking.
# 9: discard snapshots taken before a dial completed; retain undecodable calls.
# 10: skip absent SIM power-up and restore the selected AT context.
